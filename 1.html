  <h2>Destiny 2's Basis</h2><img src="web2.jpg" width="300">
  <p>In this game, players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect humanity from different alien races and combat the looming threat of the Darkness. Like the original Destiny, the game features expansion packs which further the story and adds new content across the game. Year One of Destiny 2 featured two small expansions, Curse of Osiris (December 2017) and Warmind (May 2018). A third, large expansion, Forsaken (September 2018), began Year Two with an overhaul on gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection. An Annual Pass was also available alongside this release and contained three premium content drops for Year Two (December 2018 and March and June 2019). This content became free to owners of Forsaken just prior to the release of the next expansion, Shadowkeep (October 2019), which began Year Three. Shadowkeep and future releases are considered standalone releases, not requiring players to own previous premium content. Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of Destiny 2 called New Light, a free-to-play re-release of Destiny 2, which also included access to the first two expansions. Separate seasonal passes also became available for each season's content. While the main Destiny 2 game has since been free-to-play, all other content requires purchasing.</p>
